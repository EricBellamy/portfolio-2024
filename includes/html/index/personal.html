		<div class="description description-regular">Most of my personal projects revolve around my ecosystem of
			reusable code.
			<br>
			<br>
			For NodeJS I run a private package system stored on BunnyCDN and imported into projects from a command line
			module. All of my websites use a library free static compiler, markup language and automatic website
			optimizer that are self made.
			<br>
			<br>
			Project code is backed up to two storage regions in BunnyCDN & AWS S3 daily. I love Git but no longer use it
			for personal work as it started causing problems with no benefits.

			description="Graphics programming had started to fascinate me so I spent 2 months learning barebones WebGL and ES SL shaders. Ended up with a renderer that supports proper bloom, sun shafts and reflections among other basic graphic features. <br><br>Runtime is great for a browser, at half resolution it runs at ~1-3ms/frame (300 - 1000 fps) on an integrated macbook GPU. It leaves enough performance overhead for a simple game to run on."

Both of the animations making up the intro sequence were made in Adobe After Effects. It was a lot of fun putting together the visual components for this project."
