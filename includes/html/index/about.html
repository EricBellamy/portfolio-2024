				My first experience programming was at 12 years old piecing together a bash script to brute force the

				Today Iâ€™ve been coding almost every day for over a decade. With more than 5 years of mostly web related

				I run the Tipsy Bartender website for Skyy and also operate a side business where I custom
				design and develop websites at a low monthly cost. Specifically aimed at helping small businesses.
