		<div class="description description-regular">
			Over the years i've watched every programmer I know burn out occasionally or indefinitely. Creating a
			belief that long term productivity with coding & product creation requires simplicity over anything.
			<br>
			<br>
			I've become fixated on this workflow problem primarily from two angles - The solutions and the process.
			<br>
			<br>
			Solution wise i've started focusing on what I call 80% solutions. The goal is to achieve only 80% of
			the desired
			features while eliminating at least 80% of the time & complexity. This leads to a lot of differences in
			project architecture like
			often working with
			JSON files directly instead of databases. Or almost always avoiding the need for servers by thinking about
			how else something could be done.
			<br>
			<br>
			Process wise it's all about standardization. Currently i've figured out how to unify my code structure for
			all of my NodeJS server projects, and all of my website projects. I've created a library of tools managed by
			one terminal command that automatically handles all of the typical process for these projects. From setup,
			development features, deployments and more.
			<br>
			<br>
			Now I finish ~1-2 projects per month, but more importantly I feel no burn out. It's allowed me to start
			helping people for very little mental effort. And currently I'm expanding my setup into cross platform 2D
			WebGL games.
